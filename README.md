# Sentiment-Neural-Network

Right now I have around 10,000 sentiment training data and thus using deep neural network results in 55% accuracy.
Now I will use more data to increase my accuracy

I have used TensowFlow , pandas library and NLTK library of python in this project

pos.txt and neg.txt are having positive and negative lines which i have used to generate my dataset from.
